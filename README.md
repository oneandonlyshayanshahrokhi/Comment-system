# Vanilla JavaScript Comment System

A simple comment system built with *vanilla JavaScript*.
This project is still a work in progress, and I continue adding new features and improving the structure.

## Features

* Accordion for expanding and collapsing comment threads
* Toggle actions
* Edit comments
* Delete comments
* Basic UI and dynamic DOM rendering

## Status

The core features are functional, but the project is not fully completed yet. More improvements, refinements and new features will be added soon.
